# Discord bot token and server id

You will need to create your own Discord bot in order to use DiscordBackdoorBot. The .jar file is just the controller, so to speak. You can go about installing the bot by following the below instructions.

### Creating a Discord Bot
1. Go to [https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) and click on "New Application" at the top right-hand corner. Name the bot anything you want, for example, "Discord Backdoor Bot"

2. Add details if you want. Maybe add an icon, or add a description. If you don't want to, that's fine too. After you are done customising, click on the "bot" tab on the left side of the screen.

4. De-select "public bot". You should be the only one inviting this bot into your server. Then, copy your Discord bot token. This is the token you will use when prompted by the .jar file. **IMPORTANT: DO NOT GIVE ANYONE ELSE YOUR BOT TOKEN, AS THEY CAN CONTROL YOUR BOT WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION WITH IT.**
