# DiscordBackdoorBot
Allowing server admins to backdoor their own server!

### What does Discord Backdoor Bot do?
Discord Backdoor bot allows the bot owner to create roles, delete roles, assign roles, and revoke roles, helping to give an administrator powers closer to that of the server owner.
If this bot has been given administrator permissions, it can even create new Admininstrator roles!

### But why?
Discord Backdoor bot was created due to my Discord account being banned for "suspicious activity". While I could rejoin all the servers I was in, 
I was unable to regain admin permissions in the server I owned. This lead to having to create a new Discord server, and asking all the members to join the new one, causing
inconvinence for all. 

Discord Backdoor Bot aims to allow you to continue having ownership of your server on an alternate account, even if your original account is lost/banned.

### Can't I just get my admins to create a new role for me and promote me?
You could, but you would be lacking 2 major powers: removing administrator roles, and revoking an administrator role from a rogue user. 
This bot would allow only you to have those permissions, while the rest of your admins do not.
